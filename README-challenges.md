I ran into challenges related to Flex Box. Because of this, I struggled with positioning items exactly where I wanted them on the page. It was a lot of back and forth comparing with the page on the live server. Also, the throtting in the developer tab, I did not understand exactly what that is.
I felt not so confident especially since I was out sick last week, it really hurt my confidence to work on this HW2 assignment. I worked over 15 hours each day just to make these sites look like the pictures. And even with that, I still feel like I did not do enough or as good as I could have.
